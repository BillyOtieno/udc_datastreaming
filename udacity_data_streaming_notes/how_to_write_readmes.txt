-- Documentation is a very important step of the development process.
-- Documentation for a variety of tools and processes.

-- Reverse engineering somebody elses thought process which is not an ideal scenario.
-- Technical Documentation exists to help us make sense of code, README.md for the course 
-- Director of engineering at Udacity 
        -- Support screen for the help of the screen 
        -- Handy reference of all the decisions you made in the past. 

Sections that make a README.md useful 

Title of the project
 - Description of the project

Installation
Usage

What steps need to be taken to get the codebase up and running?
Be mindful of the assumption about what the users need to make.

Documenting a growing codebase - information that is essential to your project 
Include a License --

Markdown Documentation - https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/
Github Flavored Markdown - https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/ 

Make sure your code is always documented - Easy to use and easy to maintain! -- You are writing code for humans.

COMMITS and COMMIT MESSAGES 
 - Why is the formatting of the commit messages very important?
 - Is important as you maintaing the code down the line, you need to be thorough while communicating on your commit messages. 

 Commit Message Format 
   type: the subject - a short description of what changed, plus a short annotation about the type of commit e.g. a bug fix, a feature, change to the documenation etc.


PARTICIPATING IN OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS 
 - Contribution to open source projects show's how well you work with others and how better you contribute to the code. 
 - How do you know they will work well in a team --- Issues in a repo that they have participated it, are you patient with people who are newer to the community. (its an important signal, you need engineers who interact well with the team)

HOW TO START CONTRIBUTING TO OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS 
 - Following the steps in the README.md -- Get into the community and start working on contributing on documentation, its s great way to start. Improving a documentation. Create a list of repository you like by starring it.

STARRING INTERESTING REPOSITORY 
 - Start looking for interesting coding repositories and star them.


Good idea to contribute to an existing project documentation --- look for opportunities through the documentation for the projects.

1. Commit every week, at minimum.
2. Get 2 - 4, weeks streaks of continous commits.

You want to be a better developer, make sure you commit code each and every day, atleast every week for the minimum.
