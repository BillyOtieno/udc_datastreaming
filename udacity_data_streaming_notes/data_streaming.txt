--- creating a kafka-topic with partitions
kafka-topics --create --topic kafka-arch --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 --zookeeper localhost:2181

--- inspecting the directory structure
ls -alh /var/li/kafka/data | grep kafka-arch

-- Produce Data
kafka-console-producer --topic "kafka-arch" --broker-list localhost:9092

--- Alter Kafka topics and add partitions - in this case we are adding 3 partitions
kafka-topics -alter --topic kafka-arch --partitions 3 --zookeeper localhost:2181

KAFKA TOPICS IN DEPTH

1. Kafka Topics Configuration
  --- Pros and cons of choosing the kafka partitions -- Important
  --- Considerations in choosing number of partitions for Kafka -- https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-choose-number-topics-partitions-kafka-cluster

  --- #Partitions = Max(Overall throughput/ Producer Throughput, Overall Throughput/Consumer Throughput)

  com.udacity.lession.quizcompleted --- Kafka topic naming pattern

  TOPIC DATA MANAGEMENT --- TOPIC DATA MANAGMENT
  retention time for a topic
  topics may retire dat abased on a size threshhold
  some topics used time & size-- Log Compaction
  compression algorithm on a topic - lz4, ztsd, snappy, gzip


  p2p - consumption activation || consumption activation

KAFKA CONSUMERS - CREATION AND MANAGMENT OF CONSUMERS
=====================================================

Kafka consumer offsets - Used when one wants Kafka to pick up the entire data from the beginning of the
streaming.
Consumer Groups
 - Topics | One or more partitions
 - Kafka Consumer - Group ID - Tells consumer what consumer group a consumer depends on.
 - Topic subscription
  - Full topic name, or regex topic names

Kafka Consumers - Reading Links
===============================

 - https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md

Measuring Performance of Kafka Consumer Code
=============================================
 1. Lag = Latest Topic offset - Consumer topic offset
 2. Messages per second -- (Throughput)

Data Streaming with Schemas

Schemas can communicate version compatibility on the data as it arrives.

APACHE AVRO - DATA SCHEMAS - DATA ENGINEERING SPACE
Avro - Data Serialization system that uses binary compression.
1. Avro Complex Types


Schema registry --- Any applications
Exposes an HTTP Webserver with a Rest API
Uses zookeeper to chooser a leader

KAFKA CONNECT TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS
==================================
Curl http:<connect_url>/connectors/<your_connector>/status (TO CHECK THE STATUS OF THE CONNECTOR)
curl http:<connect_url>/connectors/<your_connector>/tasks/<task_id>/status (TO CHECK ON THE STATUS OF YOUR CONNECT TASK)
